# starry-sky-enhancement
This algorithm is designed to enhance the effect of astrophotography during long exposure mode.

When taking pictures of the starry sky with a phone, due to the small photosensitive area and limited ability of the phone sensor, the exposure value needs to be increased (such as more than 3 minutes of exposure time). However, in doing so, the stars in the photos may produce a trailing effect.

By zooming in on local areas, it is easy to see that the trailing effect of stars has been eliminated and the brightness of stars is higher than that of the original photo. With this algorithm, we have overcome the limitations of phone camera sensors and greatly improved the quality of astrophotography taken with phones.
