# tarry-sky-enhancement
This algorithm is designed to enhance the effect of astrophotography during long exposure mode.

When taking pictures of the starry sky with a phone, due to the small photosensitive area and limited ability of the phone sensor, the exposure value needs to be increased (such as more than 3 minutes of exposure time). However, in doing so, the stars in the photos may produce a trailing effect.
